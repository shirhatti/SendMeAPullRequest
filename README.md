# Send me a pull request!

This repository is used to create pull requests to trigger web hooks, which call an Azure Function. Then, that Azure Function sends a message to all the clients connected using [SignalR](https://github.com/aspnet/signalr) (.NET, JavaScript, and Java clients are all available). 

Feel free to fork this repository, edit this file, and submit pull requests to get your pull request title into the demo. 

And please, make changes below the line below, and thanks for not submitting anything NSFW.
